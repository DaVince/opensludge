<h2>Using the SLUDGE Engine on Linux</h2>
<HR>

<p>If you download a SLUDGE game, the package will always contain a gamefile. It is often named <strong>gamedata</strong> or has the filename ending <strong>.slg</strong> or <strong>.dat</strong>. If the game is only distributed as a Windows installer, the gamefile can be extracted by running the installer with Wine.

<p>Once you have located the gamefile, start the game from a terminal like this:</p>

<div class="bash">sludge-engine [options] gamefile </div>

<p>Possible options are <code>--help</code> for printing the help message, <code>--window</code> or <code>--fullscreen</code> for choosing windowed or fullscreen mode, <code>--antialias=0</code> or <code>--antialias=1</code> for antialiasing off or on and <code>--language=n</code> (where <code>n</code> is an integer >= 0) for language selection. Options are saved, so you don't need to specify them every time.
If you entered a wrong language number, use <code>--language=0</code> to reset the language to the default setting.</p>

<p>While playing, you can always toggle between fullscreen and windowed mode with "Alt+Enter"
or antialiasing on and off with "Alt+A".</p>
