Wouldn't it be great if you could run your source files through a spellchecker, and it would only check the strings - not the variable names, function calls, reserved words and all the rest of that junk? Well, it's not going to happen, but SLUDGE provides the next best thing...<BR>

In the <b><a href="About_the_SLUDGE_Project_Manager.html">project manager</a></b> make sure the <b>Write strings to text file</b> option is enabled in the <b>SLUDGE Settings</b> menu. Now, the next time you compile your project, the compiler will also generate a text file containing all the strings (including the names of all the object types), one per line. The file will be created in the same directory as the output file, and with the same name (without the extension, as it appears in the <b><a href="About_the_SLUDGE_Project_Manager.html">project manager</a></b> edit box) followed by &quot;text&quot;, and with the extension &quot;.doc&quot;. You can now load this file into any program with a spellchecker and make sure your spellings are up to scratch. Potato doesn't have an &quot;e&quot; at the end, you know.<BR>

(Note that making the changes in this output file has no effect - for the changes to affect the game you must change your script files and recompile your project. Also note that if the compiler doesn't get to the stage where it writes the strings to the final file, the text file will not be created.)<BR>
