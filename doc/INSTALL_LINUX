Install SDL, libGLU and libpng developer packages
(on Ubuntu: libsdl1.2-dev, libglu1-mesa-dev and libpng12-dev).

Make sure that there are the files GLee.h and GLee.c in source/Engine.
If they are not, get the GLee source code from http://elf-stone.com/glee.php.

Get the linux version of BASS from http://www.un4seen.com/bass.html.
Copy  bass.h to /usr/include and libbass.so to /usr/lib.
Take the libbass.so from the x64 folder if you're on 64bit.

Then go to the "source" directory and run

make

If that doesn't stop with an error, do (with root rights):

make install

You can clean the source directory with

make clean

and revert the installation with 

make remove

You can start games now with 

sludge_starter gamedata.slg

Or view the help text with

sludge_starter --help

If you get no sound, close all applications that access your soundcard.
