These instructions cover building OpenSLUDGE with OpenAL as sound library (which is recommendet). You can still use BASS as sound library, see INSTALL_LINUX_BASS for instructions. The game "Frasse and the Peas of Keyick" currently still requires BASS to work properly, because it uses a sound format not supported by Alure.

Install SDL, libGLU and libpng developer packages
(on Ubuntu: libsdl1.2-dev, libglu1-mesa-dev and libpng12-dev).

OpenAL sound support requires OpenAL, Vorbis, FLAC and DUMB dev packages.
(Ubuntu: libopenal-dev, libvorbis-dev, libflac-dev, libdumb1-dev)

Get the newest version of Alure from git: http://kcat.strangesoft.net/alure.html
Version 1.0 won't work, because it doesn't have all functions used by SLUDGE!

Compile and install Alure, making sure that at least Vorbis, FLAC and DUMB support are enabled:

cmake .
make
make install

(make install requires root rights.)

Now OpenSLUDGE can be compiled.

Make sure that there are the files GLee.h and GLee.c in source/Engine.
If they are not, get the GLee source code from http://elf-stone.com/glee.php.

Then go to the "source" directory and run

make

If that doesn't stop with an error, do (with root rights):

make install

You can clean the source directory with

make clean

and revert the installation with 

make remove

You can start games now with 

sludge_engine gamedata.slg

Or view the help text with

sludge_engine --help
