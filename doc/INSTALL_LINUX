Install SDL and libpng developer packages (on Ubuntu: libsdl1.2-dev and libpng12-dev)
and GLee (homepage: http://elf-stone.com/glee.php, Ubuntu-PPA: https://launchpad.net/~miry/+archive/ppa).
After installing GLee, there should be the files
/usr/include/GLee.h and some libglee library in /usr/lib.
Get the linux version of BASS from http://www.un4seen.com.
Copy  bass.h to /usr/include and libbass.so to /usr/lib.

Then go to the "source" directory and run

make

When that doesn't stop with an error, do (with root rights):

make install

You can clean the source directory with

make clean

and revert the installation with 

make remove

You can start games now with 

sludge_engine gamedata.slg

When you get no sound, close all applications that access your soundcard, especially soundservers like PulseAudio. You can kill PulseAudio with

pulseaudio -k

Right now, the engine works only on 32bit.
