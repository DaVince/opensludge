Yes, there's not much in the way of documentation yet. But, if you're reading this, it means you've managed to check out the OpenSLUDGE source files (or get access to them online) and that's a good start!

The OpenSLUDGE project contains source code for lots of SLUDGE applications, including the project manager, compiler and engine. So far, they've only ever been compiled using CodeWarrior (the directories contain the CodeWarrior project files to do this) but you'll need to create make files or project files for your own compiler if you want to build the programs using any other compiler.

You can natter to other people about OpenSLUDGE at http://www.hungrysoftware.com/forums/go/index.cgi?group=sludge if you like.

Enjoy!
