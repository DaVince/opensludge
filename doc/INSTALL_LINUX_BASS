These instructions cover building OpenSLUDGE with BASS as sound library. Normally you should use OpenAL (see INSTALL_LINUX), but the game "Frasse and the Peas of Keyick" currently still requires BASS to work properly, because it uses a sound format not supported by Alure.

Install SDL, libGLU and libpng developer packages
(on Ubuntu: libsdl1.2-dev, libglu1-mesa-dev and libpng12-dev).

Make sure that there are the files GLee.h and GLee.c in source/Engine.
If they are not, get the GLee source code from http://elf-stone.com/glee.php.

Get the linux version of BASS from http://www.un4seen.com/bass.html.
Copy  bass.h to /usr/include and libbass.so to /usr/lib.
Take the libbass.so from the x64 folder if you're on 64bit.

Rename source/makefile-old to source/makefile and source/Engine/makefile-old to source/Engine/makefile.

Then `cd' to the "source" directory and build OpenSLUDGE with

make

If that doesn't stop with an error, do (with root rights):

make install

You can clean the source directory with

make clean

and revert the installation with 

make remove

You can start games now with 

sludge_engine gamedata.slg

Or view the help text with

sludge_engine --help

If you get no sound, first try launching SLUDGE with the sludge_engine_suspend_pa.sh script, that will try to suspend PulseAudio. If you still have problems, make sure that no other applications are accessing your soundcard.
