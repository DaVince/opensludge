<h2>freeSound</h2>
<HR>

<H3>Syntax:</H3>

<P>
<pre class="syntax">freeSound (<i>soundFile</i>);</pre>
</P>

<H3>Purpose:</H3>

<P>
Removes the <i>soundFile</i> file from the SLUDGE sound cache. Why? Because the more sounds you have in the cache - especially big ones - the more memory is taken up, and the slower your game may run on some older computers. So, if you've just finished using a huge great sound that you don't need again for a while, use this function to reclaim some memory.
</P>

<P>
Please note that the cache can only hold 8 sounds at once, so older sounds will be unloaded once they're not needed automatically anyway - you don't <i>need</i> to use freeSound to make your game work, and freeing up memory used by tiny little sounds (up to a few seconds long) won't make much of a difference.
</P>

<H3>Return value:</H3>

<P>
No return value.
</P>

<H3>Example:</H3>

<P>
<pre># Start a sound playing
playSound ('bigLongSound.wav');

# Wait 10 frames and then stop it
pause (10);
stopSound ('bigLongSound.wav');

# We don't need the sound in the cache any more...
freeSound ('bigLongSound.wav');</pre>
