Yes, you can now add translation data to your projects (one file for each language you want your game translated into) and provide games in multiple languages.
</P>

<P>
First of all, you'll need the SLUDGE translation editor. It's available separately from the rest of the SLUDGE kit so that if you want someone else to make a translation file for you, they don’t need to download and install the whole kit just to use the translation editor.
</P>

<P>
Then you need to add the translation file(s) to your project using the project manager. Compile your game and the compiler will put all the languages into the one compiled game file, ready to be played.
</P>

<P>
Each translation file should have a different ID (you can set this using the translation editor). The can then choose between languages by specifying the ID of the language you'd like to use in <a href="ini.html">your game's .ini file</a>.
</P>

<P>
The final thing you need, of course, is some way for the players of your game to pick which language they want. Want more information? You may appreciate the separate tutorial explaining how to create a menu program capable of creating a language settings file and launching your game, along with a fully-functional example for your downloading pleasure. The tutorial, example code and - of course - the translation editor itself are all available on the <a href="Download_Free_SLUDGE_Examples.html">Hungry Software website</a>.
