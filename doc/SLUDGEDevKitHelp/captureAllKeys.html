<H3>Syntax:</H3>

<P>
<pre class="syntax">captureAllKeys (<i>onOff</i>);</pre>
</P>

<H3>Purpose:</H3>

<P>
Turns on and off capturing of all keypresses, including Alt, Shift, Caps Lock, Scroll Lock and so on. Whenever a keypress is detected, your current keyboard handler is called (as specified by the <a href="onKeyboard.html">onKeyboard</a> function).
</P>

<P>
Passing in a Boolean value of FALSE turns off capture of these extended keys... passing in TRUE turns capture of every single keypress on. By default, capture of all keys is off.
</P>

<P>
If extended key capture is on, whenever an extended key is pressed your keyboard handler function will be passed a string containing a 4-digit number, representing the key that has been pressed. If extended key capture is off, your game will not react to extended keypresses. <b>In either case, your game will continue to react to standard keypresses, as described on the <a href="onKeyboard.html">onKeyboard</a> page.</b>
</P>

<H3>Return value:</H3>

<P>
No return value.
