<P>
Running the SLUDGE compiler program yourself, simply by double-clicking on the SLUDGE compiler icon, will have no effect. This is because the program requires a SLUDGE project file on which to operate. You can use the SLUDGE compiler to compile an existing SLUDGE project in four ways...
</P>

<P>
1)   Right-click a SLUDGE project (with the extension .SLP) and choose &quot;Compile&quot; from the menu which appears.
</P>

<P>
2)   Run the <a href="About_the_SLUDGE_Project_Manager.html">SLUDGE project manager</a> and open a SLUDGE project. Then hit either the <b>Compile</b> or <b>Compile and run</b> button.
</P>

<P>
3)   Double-click a SLUDGE project to load it into the <a href="About_the_SLUDGE_Project_Manager.html">SLUDGE project manager</a> and then hit either the <b>Compile</b> or <b>Compile and run</b> button.
</P>

<P>
4)   Drag a SLUDGE project onto the SLUDGE compiler icon.
</P>

<P>
The SLUDGE compiler is completely automated and will tell you of any errors which it finds with your project. If the compiler closes without warning you of any errors then your project has been compiled successfully.
