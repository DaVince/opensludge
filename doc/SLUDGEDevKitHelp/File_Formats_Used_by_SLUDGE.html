<P>
In order to create a game using SLUDGE you will have to be able to handle files using Windows. Much of the file handling in SLUDGE is automated, but in order to use graphics, sounds and music (for example) you will have to create and work with the files yourself.<BR>
</P>

<P>
<b>*</b>= These file formats can be included in a SLUDGE compiled game. See the section on <a href="File_Handling.html">file handling</a> for information on how to include these files in a compiled game. Other file types (such as HTML pages or Windows Help files) can be executed by a SLUDGE game using the <a href="launch_and_launchWith.html">launch and launchWith</a> commands. These files must then be provided with the compiled game, as they will not be included inside the file itself.<BR>
</P>

<P>
<H3>File formats specific to SLUDGE:</H3>

</P>

<P>
<B>.SLP</B><BR>
</P>

<P>
The extension given to a SLUDGE project file, as used by the <a href="About_the_SLUDGE_Project_Manager.html">SLUDGE project manager</a> and <a href="About_the_SLUDGE_Compiler.html">SLUDGE compiler</a> - these files contain the filenames of the scripts from which the game is to be built and general project data (such as a game's title, whether it should be run full-screen and so on).<BR>
</P>

<P>
<B>.SLU</B><BR>
</P>

<P>
A SLUDGE script, containing object definitions and functions. See the <a href="SLUDGE_Language_Reference_Manual.html">SLUDGE Language Reference Manual</a> for information on how to use the language.<BR>
</P>

<P>
<B>.SLD</B><BR>
</P>

<P>
A SLUDGE constant definitions file. Here you can set up your own <a href="Using_Constants_in_SLUDGE.html">constant definitions</a> (which are used in a similar way to items created using #define in C and C++).<BR>
</P>

<P>
<B>.SLG</B><BR>
</P>

<P>
A compiled SLUDGE game. Double click it to play it. Requires an up-to-date version of the SLUDGE engine to be installed on your machine. These compiled game files can be distributed as you see fit.<BR>
</P>

<P>
<B>.INI</B><BR>
</P>

<P>
See <a href="ini.html">.ini files for compiled SLUDGE games</a>.<BR>
</P>

<P>
<B>.ZBU *</B><BR>
</P>

<P>
A SLUDGE z-buffer file. These can be created using the <a href="About_the_SLUDGE_Z-Buffer_Maker.html">SLUDGE z-buffer maker</a> and can be loaded and unloaded using the <a href="setZBuffer.html">setZBuffer</a> function.<BR>
</P>

<P>
<B>.FLO *</B><BR>
</P>

<P>
A SLUDGE floor file. These can be created using the <a href="About_the_SLUDGE_Floor_Maker.html">SLUDGE floor maker</a> and can be loaded and unloaded using the <a href="setFloor.html">setFloor</a> function.<BR>
</P>

<P>
<B>.DUC *</B><BR>
</P>

<P>
A SLUDGE sprite bank file, containing one or more (or zero, but that's a bit pointless) sprites for use in a game. Sprites are used for mouse cursors, moving characters and inventory objects. Create and maintain these files using the <a href="About_the_SLUDGE_Sprite_Bank_Editor.html">SLUDGE sprite bank editor</a> and use them in animations for your game with the <a href="anim.html">anim</a> command. The extension .DUC comes from a previous Hungry Software game, Ducks, which used the same file format for its sprites.<BR>
</P>

<P>
<B>.SLX</B><BR>
</P>

<P>
An image compressed using the SLUDGE image compression algorithm. These are optionally left on your machine after compilation; you can enable and disable this feature by selecting &quot;Keep compressed images&quot; from the &quot;SLUDGE Settings&quot; <a href="Project_Manager__Menus.html">menu</a> in the <a href="About_the_SLUDGE_Project_Manager.html">SLUDGE project manager</a> application. Keeping these files decreases the time it takes to compile your game. However, you can't actually use them for anything yourself. Don't, for example, expect notepad or a paint package to make any sense of them.<BR>
</P>

<P>
<H3>Standard formats used by SLUDGE:</H3>

</P>

<P>
<B>.TGA .PNG *</B><BR>
</P>

<P>
The graphics formats with which SLUDGE works. Load images into your game using the <a href="addOverlay.html">addOverlay</a> 
function or convert images into z-buffers and sprite banks using the <a href="About_the_SLUDGE_Z-Buffer_Maker.html">SLUDGE 
z-buffer maker</a> and <a href="About_the_SLUDGE_Sprite_Bank_Editor.html">SLUDGE sprite bank editor</a> respectively.<BR>
</P>

<P>
<B>.WAV, .OGG *</B><BR>
</P>

<P>
Sound effects, music and, if you choose, recorded speech. Play these using the <a href="playSound.html">playSound</a> function, loop them with <a href="loopSound.html">loopSound</a> or make characters say or think them with the <a href="say_and_think.html">say and think</a> functions.<BR>
</P>

<P>
<B>.XM, .MOD, .IT, .S3M *</B><BR>
</P>

<P>
The track-based music formats supported by SLUDGE. Play these using the <a href="startMusic.html">startMusic</a> function.<BR>
</P>

<P>
<B>.MID, .RMI *</B><BR>
</P>

<P>
Midi music. The current SLUDGE engine cannot play these - however, you can still try, so that old projects still compile. Trying to do so, however, will produce a warning.<BR>
