<H3>Syntax:</H3>

</P>

<P>
<pre class="syntax">setFont (<i>spriteBank, charactersSupported, height</i>);</pre>
</P>

<P>
<H3>Purpose:</H3>

</P>

<P>
Changes to a new font. The font must be contained in a sprite bank, and the <i>spriteBank</i> parameter should be a file handle for this file - that is, the name of the file in single quotes. The <i>charactersSupported</i> parameter must be a string made up of - in order - each of the characters which are supported in this font. Therefore, if the fifth character in the <i>charactersSupported</i> string is A, the character A will be drawn on the screen using the fifth image in the sprite bank file.
</P>

<P>
Characters which are not present in the <i>charactersSupported</i> string are drawn as the first sprite in the sprite bank. It is therefore wise to have the first character in the font be a symbol used to represent this fact, such as an empty box or a question mark.
</P>

<P>
The <i>height</i> value must be numerical, and will be used as the gap between rows of text when using multiple status bars (created by the <a href="addStatus.html">addStatus</a> command) and when spoken text (created by the <a href="say_and_think.html">say and think</a> commands) wraps onto more than one line.
</P>

<P>
<H3>Return value:</H3>

</P>

<P>
No return value.
</P>

<P>
<H3>Example:</H3>

</P>

<P>
<pre># Load a font which only contains a question mark and numbers

# Numbers will be drawn as the second to 11th sprites in the file
# All other characters will be displayed as question marks

setFont ('numbers.duc', &quot;?0123456789&quot;, 32);</pre>
