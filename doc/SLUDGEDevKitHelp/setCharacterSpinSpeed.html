<H3>Syntax:</H3>

</P>

<P>
<pre class="syntax">setCharacterSpinSpeed (<i>thisCharacter, value</i>);</pre>
</P>

<P>
<H3>Purpose:</H3>

</P>

<P>
Changes the speed at which <i>thisCharacter</i> spins when facing a new direction, either because of a call to <a href="moveCharacter.html">moveCharacter</a> or <a href="forceCharacter.html">forceCharacter</a> or a direct change of direction using the <a href="turnCharacter_and_spinCharacter.html">spinCharacter</a> command.
</P>

<P>
The <i>value</i> parameter specifies the number of degrees through which a character can move each frame. For example, a <i>value</i> parameter of 45 would mean that the appropriate character, when facing south and being told to face north, would be shown facing south, south-east, east, north-east and, finally, north. A <i>value</i> parameter of 90 would mean that the character would only be shown facing south, east and then north.
</P>

<P>
Should <i>value</i> be 0, the angle which the character turns per frame is calculated automatically from the number of different directions represented in the character's costume.
</P>

<P>
<H3>Return value:</H3>

</P>

<P>
No return value.
