<H3>Syntax:</H3>

</P>

<P>
<pre>saveGame (<i>text</i>);</pre>
</P>

<P>
<H3>Purpose:</H3>

</P>

<P>
Creates a file with the name <i>text</i> which contains the current state of the SLUDGE engine. The <i>text</I> value must be a string <b>not</b> a <a href="File_Handling.html">file handle</a> for this command to work as expected! The <a href="loadGame.html">loadGame</a> command can then be used to load in one of these files to return the engine to exactly the same state.<BR>
</P>

<P>
Your saved game files, as well as containing all the information needed to restore a player's progress at any time, can also (optionally) contain a thumbnail image. The size of the image generated and saved can be set using <a href="setThumbnailSize.html">setThumbnailSize</a>.<BR>
</P>

<P>
Currently, games cannot be saved while anything is frozen (using the <a href="freeze.html">freeze</a> command).<BR>
</P>

<P>
Note that when the loadGame command is called successfully and the engine returns to its state when the file was created, execution will restart after the call to saveGame, <b>not</b> after the call to loadGame. This is because everything - including the function which called the saveGame command - is saved to the file and therefore restored when loadGame is called. You can tell whether you've just loaded or saved a game by looking at the return value.<BR>
</P>

<P>
This function supports filename bodging - for details see the <a href="bodgeFilenames.html">bodgeFilenames</a> command.<BR>
</P>

<P>
<H3>Return value:</H3>

</P>

<P>
Returns TRUE if the state of the engine was just saved. Returns FALSE if the game has just restarted at this point after a call to loadGame.<BR>
