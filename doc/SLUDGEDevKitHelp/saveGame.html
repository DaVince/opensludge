<h2>saveGame</h2>
<HR>


<P>
<H3>Syntax:</H3>

</P>

<P>
<pre class="syntax">saveGame (<i>text</i>);</pre>
</P>

<P>
<H3>Purpose:</H3>

</P>

<P>
Creates a file with the name <i>text</i> which contains the current state of the 
SLUDGE engine. The <i>text</I> value must be a string <b>not</b> a 
<a href="File_Handling.html">file handle</a> for this command to work as expected! 
The <a href="loadGame.html">loadGame</a> command can then be used to load in one 
of these files to return the engine to exactly the same state.
</P>

<p>Any run-time files which your SLUDGE game uses (i.e. any custom data or saved 
game files) will be created in (and loaded from) the application data folder of 
the game. (Documents and Settings/username/Application Data/Game Name
on Windows, $HOME/.sludge-engine/Game Name on Linux and 
User/Application Support/Game Name on Mac). See also 
<a href="Project_Manager__Project_Settings_Dialog.html"></a>.</p>

<P>
Your saved game files, as well as containing all the information needed to restore 
a player's progress at any time, can also (optionally) contain a thumbnail image. 
The size of the image generated and saved can be set using <a href="setThumbnailSize.html">setThumbnailSize</a>.
</P>

<P>
Currently, games cannot be saved while anything is frozen (using the <a href="freeze.html">freeze</a> command).
</P>

<P>
Note that when the loadGame command is called successfully and the engine returns to its state when the file was created, execution will restart after the call to saveGame, <b>not</b> after the call to loadGame. This is because everything - including the function which called the saveGame command - is saved to the file and therefore restored when loadGame is called. You can tell whether you've just loaded or saved a game by looking at the return value.
</P>

<P>
This function supports filename bodging - for details see the <a href="bodgeFilenames.html">bodgeFilenames</a> command.
</P>

<P>
<H3>Return value:</H3>

</P>

<P>
Returns TRUE if the state of the engine was just saved. Returns FALSE if the game has just restarted at this point after a call to loadGame.
