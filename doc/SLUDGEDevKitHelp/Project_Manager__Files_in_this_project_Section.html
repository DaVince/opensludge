<h2>Project Manager: &quot;Files in this project&quot; Section</h2>
<HR>


<P>
The list at the top of this area shows all the scripts which make up this project. Each is a separate file. The file locations shown are based on the location of the currently loaded project file.
</P>

<P>
The files shown here should be text files with the extension &quot;.SLU&quot; (for scripts), &quot;.SLD&quot; (for <a href="Using_Constants_in_SLUDGE.html">constants</a>) or &quot;.TRA&quot; (for <a href="Multiple_Languages_in_a_Single_Game.html">translation</a> files). The order of the files is not important (unless your script attempts to set the start value of a global variable to another which has not yet been created). Prototyping functions and externing variables from other files is not required.
</P>

<P>
You can select a file in this list by clicking it with the mouse. You can also select multiple files - for example, by holding down your keyboard's control (&quot;Ctrl&quot;) key and clicking on subsequent files with the mouse.
</P>

<P>
Below the list there are five buttons which are used to manipulate the files.
</P>

<P>
<b>Edit:
</P>

<P>
</b>Any files selected in the list are opened for editing. (By default, Windows Notepad will be used. You can change this by opening the <b>SLUDGE Settings</b> <a href="Project_Manager__Menus.html">menu</a> and selecting <b>File locations</b>. If you’ve selected any <a href="Multiple_Languages_in_a_Single_Game.html">translation</a> files, they’ll always be opened in the appropriate editor, not the text editor.)
</P>

<P>
<b>Resources:
</P>

<P>
</b>A dialog box will appear listing all the resources which are used by the files selected above. (You can then launch these files from the dialog box, saving you having to track them down using Windows Explorer.)
</P>

<P>
<b>Delete:
</P>

<P>
</b>Removes the selected items from the list. (The files themselves are not deleted from your computer - they just won't be included the next time the project is compiled. If you want to physically delete the files from your machine, you must use Windows.)
</P>

<P>
<b>Add file:
</P>

<P>
</b>Adds a new, or an existing, file to the list. (A standard Windows file open box will appear from which you can select a file to add, or if you want to create a new file, type a filename. Use the box at the bottom of the dialog box to choose between scripts, <a href="Using_Constants_in_SLUDGE.html">constants</a> and <a href="Multiple_Languages_in_a_Single_Game.html">translation</a> data.)
</P>

<P>
<b>Find in files:
</P>

<P>
</b>Displays a dialog box which lets you search through the contents of the project for a specific string of characters. (The results are then displayed in the dialog box used by the Resources button.)
