<h2>transitionMode and transitionLevel</h2>
<HR>


<H3>Syntax:</H3>

<P>
<pre class="syntax">transitionMode (<i>mode</i>);</pre>
</P>

<P>
<pre class="syntax">transitionLevel (<i>level</i>);</pre>
</P>

<H3>Purpose:</H3>

<P>
The transitionMode function chooses which transition type is used by the game. Valid values for <i>mode</i> are:
</P>

<P>
<b>FADE   </b>Every pixel's brightness is faded to / from black.
</P>

<P>
<b>DISOLVE   </b>A fixed selection of pixels is coloured over in black.
</P>

<P>
<b>DISOLVE1   </b>The same as DISOLVE.
</P>

<P>
<b>DISOLVE2   </b>A random selection of pixels is coloured over in black.
</P>

<P>
<b>TVSTATIC   </b>A random selection of pixels is coloured over in random greys.
</P>

<P>
<b>BLINDS   </b>The screen is divided into horizontal slices which open like blinds.
</P>

<P>
<b>SNAPSHOTFADE   </b>The screen is faded to / from the current snapshot. *
</P>

<P>
<b>CROSSFADE   </b>The same as SNAPSHOTFADE.
</P>

<P>
<b>SNAPSHOTBOX   </b>The screen appears in an expanding rectangle over the current snapshot. *
</P>

<P>
The transitionLevel function specifies how visible the current screen is, from 0 to 256 inclusive. A <i>level</i> value of 0 means the scene is not visible at all (normally pitch black). A <i>level</i> value of 256 means the scene is completely visible and not affected by the current transition mode at all.
</P>

<P>
Note that the mouse cursor is <i>not</i> affected by transitions. All other elements - including speech, characters and status text - are affected.
</P>

<P>
 * = See <a href="snapshotGrab.html">snapshotGrab</a> for more information. This transition mode has no effect if there is currently no snapshot in memory.
</P>

<H3>Example:</H3>

<P>
<pre># Choose which mode we want to use
transitionMode (DISOLVE2);

# Fade up
for (var a = 0; a &lt; 255; a += 10) {
   transitionLevel (a);
   pause (1);
}
transitionLevel (256);

# Wait a while
pause (100);

# Fade down
for (var a = 255; a &gt; 0; a -= 10) {
   transitionLevel (a);
   pause (1);
}
transitionLevel (0);</pre>
</P>

<H3>Return value:</H3>

<P>
No return value.
