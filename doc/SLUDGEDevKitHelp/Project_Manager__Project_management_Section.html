</P>

<P>
<b>Create new project:<BR>
</P>

<P>
</b>Opens a standard Windows file save box, where you can choose a location and name for the project file you wish to create. The new file will be created containing no script files and its <a href="Project_Manager__Project_settings_Section.html">project settings</a> and <a href="Project_Manager__Project_properties_Dialog.html">project properties</a> will be set to default values.<BR>
</P>

<P>
<b>Open existing project:<BR>
</P>

<P>
</b>Opens a standard Windows file open box which lets you locate the project file which you want to load.<BR>
</P>

<P>
<b>Save project:<BR>
</P>

<P>
</b>Saves the current project. The file from which the project was loaded (or specified when the project was created) will be overwritten. To save the project into a new location, use the <b>Save as...</b> option on the <b>File</b> <a href="Project_Manager__Menus.html">menu</a> instead.<BR>
