<P>
This area contains eight buttons which allow you to work with entire projects.
</P>

<P>
<b>Create new project:
</P>

<P>
</b>Opens a standard Windows file save box, where you can choose a location and name for the project file you wish to create. The new file will be created containing no script files and its <a href="Project_Manager__Project_settings_Section.html">project settings</a> and <a href="Project_Manager__Project_properties_Dialog.html">project properties</a> will be set to default values.
</P>

<P>
<b>Open existing project:
</P>

<P>
</b>Opens a standard Windows file open box which lets you locate the project file which you want to load.
</P>

<P>
<b>Save project:
</P>

<P>
</b>Saves the current project. The file from which the project was loaded (or specified when the project was created) will be overwritten. To save the project into a new location, use the <b>Save as...</b> option on the <b>File</b> <a href="Project_Manager__Menus.html">menu</a> instead.
</P>

<b>Compile project:

<P>
</b>Runs the <a href="About_the_SLUDGE_Compiler.html">SLUDGE compiler</a> and, errors permitting, creates a compiled SLUDGE game (.SLG) file. The name of the file will be that which is specified in the <a href="Project_Manager__Project_settings_Section.html">Project settings</a> section.
</P>

<P>
<b>Compile and run project:
</P>

</b>Identical to the Compile project button, except that the compiled game - should one be successfully created - will be run immediately.
</P>
