The stack variable type is the only type of variable in SLUDGE which can hold more than one element. It can be used as a stack (push elements on using <a href="pushToStack.html">pushToStack</a> and then use <a href="popFromStack.html">popFromStack</a> to pop them off the same end), a queue (<a href="enqueue.html">enqueue</a> elements, <a href="dequeue.html">dequeue</a> them off the opposite end) or a straightforward array (which can be indexed using square brackets). With the implementation used in SLUDGE, <a href="dequeue.html">dequeue</a> and <a href="popFromStack.html">popFromStack</a> are identical.
</P>

<P>
Throughout this documentation, they are referred to as stacks.

Take, for example, the following code:
</P>

<P>
<pre>var stuff = newStack (&quot;Hello?&quot;, &quot;Hey!&quot;, &quot;Bye then.&quot;);
# stuff now contains &quot;Hello?&quot;, &quot;Hey!&quot;, &quot;Bye then.&quot;

pushToStack (stuff, &quot;Aarrgghh!&quot;);
# stuff now contains &quot;Aarrgghh!&quot;, &quot;Hello?&quot;, &quot;Hey!&quot;, &quot;Bye then.&quot;

enqueue (stuff, &quot;Er...?&quot;);
# stuff now contains &quot;Aarrgghh!&quot;, &quot;Hello?&quot;, &quot;Hey!&quot;, &quot;Bye then.&quot;, &quot;Er...?&quot;

var a = popFromStack (stuff);
# stuff now contains &quot;Hello?&quot;, &quot;Hey!&quot;, &quot;Bye then.&quot;, &quot;Er...?&quot;
# a contains &quot;Aarrgghh!&quot;

var b = dequeue (stuff);
# stuff now contains &quot;Hey!&quot;, &quot;Bye then.&quot;, &quot;Er...?&quot;
# b contains &quot;Hello?&quot;

var c = stuff[1];
# stuff still contains &quot;Hey!&quot;, &quot;Bye then.&quot;, &quot;Er...?&quot;
# c contains &quot;Bye then.&quot;

deleteFromStack (stuff, c);
# stuff now contains &quot;Hey!&quot;, &quot;Er...?&quot;</pre>
</P>

<P>
When treating a stack as a Boolean, it is considered to be TRUE if it is nonempty and FALSE if it is empty. Therefore you can use the following structure to loop until a stack is empty (this example makes the ego character say every element of the stack in order):
</P>

<P>
<pre>while (myStack) say (ego, popFromStack (myStack));</pre>
</P>

<P>
A good example of using these stacks is for implementation of an inventory. Some built-in functions which return more than one element (<a href="getMatchingFiles.html">getMatchingFiles</a> and <a href="wait.html">wait</a> for example) also return information using the stack variable type.
