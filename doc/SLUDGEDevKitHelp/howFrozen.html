<H3>Syntax:</H3>

<P>
<pre class="syntax">howFrozen (<i>howFrozen</i>);</pre>
</P>

<H3>Purpose:</H3>

<P>
Counts how many more times the game has been frozen than unfrozen: that is, the number of times which the <a href="unfreeze.html">unfreeze</a> command must be called in order to return to a completely unfrozen state (in which it is possible to save the current game - that is to say, <a href="saveGame.html">saveGame</a> will not work unless the return value from howFrozen is 0).
</P>

<H3>Return value:</H3>

<P>
The return value is a number: 0 if the game isn't frozen, otherwise the number represents how many frozen levels currently exist.
