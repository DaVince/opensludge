<h2>About the SLUDGE Translation Editor</h2>
   <HR>

   <A NAME=whatis><H3>What is the SLUDGE Translation Editor?</H3></A>

   <P>The SLUDGE Translation Editor is a program (on Win/Linux) or a part of the
   Development Kit program (Mac: New Translation in the Tools menu) which helps 
   you create translation data for SLUDGE 
   games. You know, so you can play the same game in multiple languages without lots 
   of rewriting of code. This is how it looks like:</P>

   <P><IMG SRC="images/translationeditor.png"></P>

   <P>The SLUDGE Translation Editor has been specifically designed so that you don't 
   need to understand the SLUDGE language in order to create a translation file. 
   Neither do you need to be the author of the game being translated, neither do 
   you need access to the source code. If you've written a SLUDGE game and want 
   someone to create you a translation file, simply build them a file with 
   everything left in the "Strings that are missing translations" category and 
   send it to them. If, on the other hand, you've been inlisted to create a 
   translation file for someone else's game, skip straight to the 
   <A HREF=#edit>editing section</A> of this file.</P>

   <A NAME=adding><H3>Adding strings to a translation file</H3></A>
  
   <P>If you're starting a new translation file you'll obviously need to import some 
   strings from somewhere. (Also, if you're working with an existing translation 
   file and the strings in the project you're translating change, you may well need 
   to update the strings you're translating.) To import all the strings used in a 
   SLUDGE project, click the "Load strings from project" button. Select your project 
   file and hit OK. The SLUDGE Translation Editor will scan through the project and 
   pull out all the strings that it contains. Any new strings that it finds will be 
   added to the loaded translation data (if you're starting a new file from scratch 
   all the strings will be added, because it'll know about no strings already).</P>

   <P>Should there be any newly-added strings, they will appear in the category 
   "Strings that are missing translations".</P>
   
   <A NAME=edit><H3>Editing a translation file</H3></A>

   <P>If the file you want to edit isn't currently loaded, open it using the "Open" 
   option on the "File" menu or double click the translation file, which should 
   start the SLUDGE Translation Editor and load the file automatically.</P>

   <P>There are three categories into which strings can be divided, and each string 
   will be found in one (and only one) of these categories. The category "Strings 
   that are missing translations" contains all the strings which haven't yet been 
   dealt with. To take care of this, select "Show strings that are missing 
   translations" from the drop-down selection box. Pick a string, and it should 
   appear in the area at the bottom of the screen. If the string needs to be 
   translated, type your translation into the right column of the table. If the 
   string doesn't require translating - for example, a file name or a string that 
   looks like ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789@()*&# - then simply uncheck the 
   box in the "Translate?" column. In either case, the string will vanish from the 
   "Strings that are missing translations" category.</P>

   <P>Strings which have had the "Translate?" box unchecked can be found in the 
   category "Strings that don't need translation". Strings which have been 
   translated can be found in the category "Translated strings". You can select 
   these categories using the drop-down selection box and change the settings for 
   each string in the same way as above.</P>

   <A NAME=find><H3>Finding a specific string</H3></A>
   
   <P>To find a specific string (in the Windows/Linux Translation Editor), type it 
   into the box labeled <b>Find</b>. As you type, the first string in the displayed 
   category that contains what you are typing is highlighted. Use the arrow keys to 
   jump to possible other strings also containing the searched characters.</P>
   
   <P>The program will also match your text against any existing translations in the 
   file. So, if you've translated "Hello" into "Bonjour" and "On the table" into 
   "Sur la table", searching for "on" will match both (because of the translation 
   of the first line, and the original text of the second).</P>

   <A NAME=id><H3>Language ID and name</H3></A>
   
   <P>What we haven't discussed yet are the language ID and name fields at the top 
   of the Translation Editor window. The name will be viewed by the engine when it 
   comes to selecting a language. The ID is used internally to distinguish between 
   languages, so make sure that every language in your game has a unique ID.</P>

   <A NAME=save><H3>Saving a translation file</H3></A>
   
   <P>When you've finished working on your translation file, you can save it using 
   the "File" menu. Choose the "Save" option from the menu if you want to overwrite 
   the file from which the data was loaded (or to which the data was last saved). 
   Choose "Save as" if you want to save the data into a new file.</P>
