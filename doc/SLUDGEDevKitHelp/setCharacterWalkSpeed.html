<h2>setCharacterWalkSpeed</h2>
<HR>

<H3>Syntax:</H3>

<P>
<pre class="syntax">setCharacterWalkSpeed (<i>thisCharacter, value</i>);</pre>
</P>

<H3>Purpose:</H3>

<P>
Changes the speed at which <i>thisCharacter</i> moves around the current scene. The character must already have been added to the screen using the <a href="addCharacter.html">addCharacter</a> command. When a character is added to the screen, its walking speed is set to the default walking speed as defined in the <i>thisCharacter</i> object type - if the object type contains no default walk speed information, the default walk speed is set to 5.
</P>

<P>
If <i>thisCharacter</i> is an object type which is not currently represented on the screen as a character, the code has no effect.
</P>

<H3>Return value:</H3>

<P>
TRUE if <i>thisCharacter</i> is an object type which is currently represented on the screen as a character, otherwise FALSE (i.e. TRUE if the call to the function was a success).
