<h2>setScale</h2>
<HR>

<H3>Syntax:</H3>

<P>
<pre class="syntax">setScale (<i>horizon, divide</i>);</pre>
</P>

<H3>Purpose:</H3>

<P>
Changes the scaling for characters. The <i>horizon</i> value represents the level (y co-ordinate) of the horizon on the screen. The <i>divide</i> parameter is how quickly characters grow and shrink as they move towards or away from the horizon. The scale at which a character is drawn is calculated using the algorithm scale = (y position - horizon) / divide.
</P>

<P>
If the divide value is 0, no scaling will be applied to characters when they move; each character will continue to be drawn at the size in which it was previously drawn. In this situation, new characters added using <a href="addCharacter.html">addCharacter</a> will be created with a scale value of 1.
</P>

<P>
Changing the scale does not affect characters which aren't currently moving. Adding a character and then changing the scale will not resize the character, until the character is told to move.
</P>

<H3>Return value:</H3>

<P>
No return value.
