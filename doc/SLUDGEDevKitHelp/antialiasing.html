When a character is drawn to the screen, it uses the character's current anti-aliasing settings, clamped so they don't exceed the game's current maximum anti-aliasing settings. By default, a character's anti-aliasing settings (and the maximum anti-aliasing settings) will be the ones defined using the character rendering settings dialog box in the project manager. You can also change the settings using <b><a href="setCharacterAntiAliasing.html">setCharacterAntiAliasing</b></a> and <b><a href="setMaximumAntiAliasing.html">setMaximumAntiAliasing</b></a>.<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0><TR ALIGN=CENTER><TD><img border=1 src="images/aa-off.jpg" width=140 height=130><BR><B>OFF</B><BR><TD><img src="images/aa-0.jpg" border=1 width=140 height=130><BR><B>SOFTNESS 0</B><BR><TD><img border=1 src="images/aa-4.jpg" width=140 height=130><BR><B>SOFTNESS 4</B><BR><TD><img src="images/aa-20.jpg" width=140 height=130 border=1><BR><B>SOFTNESS 20</B><BR></TABLE><P></CENTER>To help show the difference between the above images, here they are in close-up. Note how images drawn at their "correct" size (where 1 pixel in the sprite translates to 1 pixel on the screen - for example, the duck and the inventory logo) look identical when the anti-aliasing is enabled and softness is set to 0.<P><CENTER><img border=1 src="images/aa-off.jpg" width=420 height=390><BR><B>OFF</B><BR>

This is even more apparent with large sprites or with sprites scaled up to cover large parts of the screen. It's therefore recommended that if you're going to use anti-aliasing in your game, you give the player the opportunity to enable and disable it, and perhaps even choose the graphics quality themselves (eg. a key which cycles through setting the anti-aliasing to off, on with softness 0 and on with softness 4, or a slider in the game's pause menu). Because it's also possible for the game to get the (on or off part of the) initial anti-aliasing setting from <b><a href="ini.html">the game's .ini file</a></b>, this functionality could also be added to a seperate startup menu which writes out the appropriate .ini file and then launches your game.<BR>
