<h2>Variable Operations</h2>
<HR>


<P>
The following operations are supported in SLUDGE:
</P>

<P>
<B>A + B</B>
</P>

<P>
If both values are numbers, the result is the total of the two numbers. If one value is not a number, the result is a string containing the string representation of the first value followed by the string representation of the second. For example, 1+2 is the number 3, whereas 1+&quot;2&quot; is the string &quot;12&quot;.
</P>

<P>
<B>A - B</B>
</P>

<P>
Both values must be numbers. The result is the first number minus the second.
</P>

<P>
<B>A * B</B>
</P>

<P>
Both values must be numbers. The result is the first number multiplied by the second.
</P>

<P>
<B>A / B</B>
</P>

<P>
Both values must be numbers. The result is the first number divided by the second. The second number cannot be 0.
</P>

<P>
<B>A % B</B>
</P>

<P>
Both values must be numbers. The result is the remainder when the first number is divided by the second (or the modulus). The second number cannot be 0.
</P>

<P>
<B>A &amp;&amp; B</B>
</P>

<P>
Both values are treated as boolean. The result is true if both values are TRUE, otherwise it is FALSE..
</P>

<P>
<B>A || B</B>
</P>

<P>
Both values are treated as boolean. The result is TRUE if either value is TRUE, otherwise it is FALSE.
</P>

<P>
<B>A = B</B>
</P>

<P>
Changes the value of A so that it now contains the same data as B. The same value is given as the result, meaning that the code A=B=C=D=E=8 will set all five variables to the numerical value 8.
</P>

<P>
<B>A == B</B>
</P>

<P>
The result is TRUE if both values are of the same type and if the contents match, otherwise it is FALSE.
</P>

<P>
<B>A != B</B>
</P>

<P>
The result is FALSE if both values are of the same type and if the contents match, otherwise it is TRUE.
</P>

<P>
<B>A &gt; B</B>
</P>

<P>
Both values must be numbers. The result is TRUE if the first number is greater than the second, otherwise it is FALSE.
</P>

<P>
<B>A &lt; B</B>
</P>

<P>
Both values must be numbers. The result is TRUE if the first number is less than the second, otherwise it is FALSE.
</P>

<P>
<B>- A</B>
</P>

<P>
The value must be a number. The result is 0 minus the original value.
</P>

<P>
<B>! A</B>
</P>

<P>
The value is treated as boolean. The result is FALSE if the value is TRUE, and TRUE if the value is FALSE.
</P>

<P>
<B>A ? B : C</B>
</P>

<P>
The first value is treated as boolean. The result is B if the value is TRUE and C if the value is FALSE.
</P>

<P>
<B>A ++</B>
</P>

<P>
Increases the value of A by 1. A must be a number; if not, the code has no effect. The return value is the old value of A.
</P>

<P>
<B>A --</B>
</P>

<P>
Decreases the value of A by 1. A must be a number; if not, the code has no effect. The return value is the old value of A.
</P>

<P>
<B>A += B</B>
</P>

<P>
Adds A to B and stores the result in A. <a href="Problems_with_compound_operators_in_SLUDGE.html">*</a>
</P>

<P>
<B>A -= B</B>
</P>

<P>
Takes B from A and stores the result in A. <a href="Problems_with_compound_operators_in_SLUDGE.html">*</a>
</P>

<P>
<B>A *= B</B>
</P>

<P>
Multiplies A and B and stores the result in A. <a href="Problems_with_compound_operators_in_SLUDGE.html">*</a>
</P>

<P>
<B>A /= B</B>
</P>

<P>
Divides A by B and stores the result in A. <a href="Problems_with_compound_operators_in_SLUDGE.html">*</a>
</P>

<P>
<B>A %= B</B>
</P>

<P>
Performs the operation A % B and stores the result in A. <a href="Problems_with_compound_operators_in_SLUDGE.html">*</a>
</P>

<P>
(For operations in which the value or values must be numbers, the engine will quit with a Fatal Error message box if non-numbers are used.)
