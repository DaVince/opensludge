<h2>How to Release the Finished Game</h2>
<HR>

<P>
Once you've finished your game, you probably want to let other people play it. The
most important file for that is the one with the .slg file ending. That stands for
"SLUDGE Game", and that file contains everything that is your game. In order to
play it, the SLUDGE engine is needed, so you probably want to distribute that 
together with your game.
</P>

<h3>On Windows</h3>

<p>On Windows, most programs are distributed with installer/uninstaller programs. 
<a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/">NSIS</a> is one of the most popular systems
for creating installers, and you can find <a href="http://opensludge.sourceforge.net/Sample%20Installer.nsi">
a sample NSIS script for SLUDGE games</a> on the SLUDGE site.</p>

<p>If you don't have access to a Windows computer, try asking for help on 
<a href="http://www.adventuredevelopers.com/forum/"the Adventure Developers forum</a>.</p>

<h3>On Mac OS X</h3>

<p>On Mac OS X, programs are typically contained in .app bundles. To make a bundle
with your game, first rename your .slg file to Gamedata.slg, then open the engine
bundle (secondary-click on the engine file in Finder, and select "Show Package Contents")
and place the game file in Contents/Resources. Now the game will load automatically
when you run the engine. Just zip it up (secondary click in finder - "Compress...")
and send it to your players!</p>

<p>If you want to replace the icon shown in Finder, you can replace the file 
"Sludge.icns" with your own icon.</p>

<p>If you don't have access to a Mac computer, try asking for help on 
<a href="http://www.adventuredevelopers.com/forum/"the Adventure Developers forum</a>.</p>

<h3>On Linux</h3>

<p>For Linux users, distributing the .slg file by itself and pointing to where 
SLUDGE can be downloaded should do the trick.</p>
