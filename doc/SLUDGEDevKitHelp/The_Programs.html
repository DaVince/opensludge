<h2>The Programs</h2>
<HR>


<P>
On Windows and Linux, the SLUDGE development kit consists of several programs. You should be able to find them on your Windows Start menu, in the SLUDGE section of your list of programs. Failing that, find the folder into which you installed SLUDGE on your machine, and launch the program of your choice from there.
</P>
<p>
On Mac OS X, the SLUDGE development kit is a single program, but it still works in
mostly the same way.
</p>

<P>
Help on using the various programs comes in the following flavours:
