The SLUDGE development kit consists of several programs. You should be able to find them on your Windows Start menu, in the SLUDGE section of your list of programs. Failing that, find the folder into which you installed SLUDGE on your machine, and launch the program of your choice from there.

<P>
Help on using the various programs comes in the following flavours:

<P>
There's no page here about the SLUDGE engine, because it's not included with the development kit. It's a stand-alone program which can be downloaded seperately - consequently, in order for people to play your game, they need not have the whole of the development kit on their machine, only the engine (and your game file, of course). However, check below for a few notes on making the engine do what you want (or what your player wants).
