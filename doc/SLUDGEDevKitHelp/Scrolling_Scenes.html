<h2>Scrolling Scenes</h2>
<HR>


<P>
When SLUDGE starts, an initial (blank) <a href="The_Background_Image.html">background image</a> is set up to be the same width and height as set for the project in the <a href="Project_Manager__Project_Settings_Dialog.html">Project Settings dialog</a> in the <a href="About_the_SLUDGE_Project_Manager.html">SLUDGE Project Manager</a> application. However, you can change the size of the background image to an area larger than the window or screen. Then, by moving a &quot;camera&quot;, you can view different areas within the scene... the technique known as scrolling.
</P>

<P>
To change the size of the background image, use the <a href="setSceneDimensions.html">setSceneDimensions</a> function. Then, load your graphics in the usual way; using the <a href="addOverlay.html">addOverlay</a> function. Remember, if you want to change the size of background image back to the values specified in the project manager you will need to call the setSceneDimensions function again, with the original values as parameters.
</P>

<P>
When the background is resized, the camera is moved to the top left hand corner of the total area. To move the camera elsewhere in the scene, use the <a href="aimCamera.html">aimCamera</a> function.
</P>

<H3>Parallax Scrolling:</H3>

<P>
SLUDGE can handle multiple layered parallax scrolling. Each layer can be added 
using a single call to the built-in <a href="parallaxAdd.html">parallaxAdd</a> 
function and any parallax layers loaded will be visible through areas of your 
scene coloured bright cyan (0, 255, 255 or #00FFFF). (With 32-bit images, the alpha
channel is used for transparency instead!)
The function <a href="parallaxClear.html">parallaxClear</a> removes all loaded 
parallax layers from memory.
