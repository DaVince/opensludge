<b>Keep compressed images:
</P>

<P>
</b>If this option is checked, the compressed images generated during compilation will be kept on your machine after compilation.

</P>

<P>
<b>Write strings to text file:
</P>

<P>
</b>During compilation, generate a file containing all the strings used in your game. Useful if you want to <a href="Spellchecking_the_Strings_in_your_Game.html">spellcheck</a> the strings without also spellchecking your SLUDGE code.
</P>

<P>
<b>Verbose errors (development mode):
</P>

<P>
</b>Include function names and other debugging information in your compiled game. This means that run-time error messages are more meaningful. It's recommended that you keep this option checked while developing a game, and uncheck it before compiling a release version.
</P>

<P>
