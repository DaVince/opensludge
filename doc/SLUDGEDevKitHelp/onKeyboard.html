<h2>onKeyboard</h2>
<HR>


<P>
<H3>Syntax:</H3>

</P>

<P>
<pre class="syntax">onKeyboard (<i>handlerFunction</i>);</pre>
</P>

<P>
<pre class="syntax">onKeyboard ();</pre>
</P>

<P>
<H3>Purpose:</H3>

</P>

<P>
Tells the computer which function to call when a button on the keyboard is pressed. The value of <i>handlerFunction</i> must be a pointer to a function which takes one parameter. When a keyboard button is pressed, the function specified in <i>handlerFunction</i> will be called with the key which was pressed passed as a string to the parameter.
</P>

<P>
If no parameter is given, the program stops calling the current keyboard handler function. No function will be called when the user presses a keyboard button until another call to onKeyboard tells the machine otherwise.
</P>

<P>
Note that only one handler for the keyboard can be used at any one time. A subsequent call to onKeyboard will replace the current handler function.
</P>

<P>
For normal characters, your keyboard handler will simply by passed the individual character as a string. For some special characters, however, the handler will be passed a longer string, the content of which specifies what key has been pressed:
</P>

<P>
<b>&quot;ENTER&quot;   </b>The player pressed either the enter or return key
</P>

<P>
<b>&quot;BACKSPACE&quot;   </b>The player pressed the backspace key
</P>

<P>
<b>&quot;ESCAPE&quot;   </b>The player pressed the escape key
</P>

<P>
<b>&quot;F1&quot; - &quot;F12&quot;   </b>The player pressed one of the function keys
</P>

<P>
<b>&quot;DELETE&quot;   </b>The player pressed the delete key
</P>

<P>
<b>&quot;INSERT&quot;   </b>The player pressed the insert key
</P>

<P>
<b>&quot;HOME&quot;   </b>The player pressed the home key
</P>

<P>
<b>&quot;END&quot;   </b>The player pressed the end key
</P>

<P>
<b>&quot;PAGE UP&quot;   </b>The player pressed the page up key
</P>

<P>
<b>&quot;PAGE DOWN&quot;   </b>The player pressed the page down key
</P>

<P>
<b>&quot;UP&quot;, &quot;DOWN&quot;, &quot;LEFT&quot;, &quot;RIGHT&quot;   </b>The player pressed one of the cursor keys
</P>

<P>
<b>&quot;ALT+A&quot; - &quot;ALT+Z&quot;   </b>The player held down Alt and pressed a letter
</P>

<P>
<b>&quot;ALT+F1&quot; - &quot;ALT+F12&quot;   </b>The player held down Alt and pressed a function key
</P>

<P>
Note that, at least on the machines on which SLUDGE has been tested so far, pressing F10 will generate an &quot;ALT+F10&quot; message, <b>not</b> an &quot;F10&quot; message as you'd reasonably expect. Also, it seems to be oblivious to users holding down Alt and hitting F6 for some reason. Go figure.

<P>
<H3>Return value:</H3>

</P>

<P>
No return value.
