Yes, there's not much in the way of documentation of the source code yet. But, if you're reading this, it means you've managed to check out the OpenSLUDGE source files (or get access to them online) and that's a good start!

The OpenSLUDGE project contains source code for lots of SLUDGE applications, including the project manager, compiler and engine. Originally, they've only ever been compiled using CodeWarrior, but now it compiles in both Xcode on Mac and GNU make on Linux. The Windows engine is compiled using Dev-C++, the Windows Dev Kit with MinGW.

For installation instructions, see INSTALL.

You can natter to other people about OpenSLUDGE at 
http://www.adventuredevelopers.com/forum/ if you like.

Enjoy!
