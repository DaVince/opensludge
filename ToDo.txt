This is a possible to-do list. Not everything here may be a good idea, but it's a collection of ideas and wishes so they don't are forgotten.

* Add animation creation in the Sprite Bank Editor?
* Allow launching of one SLUDGE game from within another?
* SVG?
* Added control of animations? (Nonlooping)
* Lip sync?

Known bugs:

* BLINDS transition mode not yet supported with GLES2.
* Parallax scrolling bug with GLES2.
