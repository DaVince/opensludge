This is a possible to-do list. Not everything here may be a good idea, but it's a collection of ideas and wishes so they don't are forgotten.

* Movie support

* Add animation creation in the Sprite Bank Editor?
* Allow launching of one SLUDGE game from within another?
* SVG?
* Added control of animations? (Nonlooping)
* Lip sync?
* OpenGL ES 2 support (needed for mobile ports)?
