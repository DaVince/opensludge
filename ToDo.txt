* Document the new zoomCamera function

This is a possible to-do list. Not everything here may be a good idea, but it's a collection of ideas and wishes so they don't are forgotten.

* Let games replace the logo in the setup window?
* Allow launching of one SLUDGE game from within another.
* Movie support (this is one for the future - not planned for SLUDGE 2.0)
* Sprite-bank-editor: Allow setting hotspot for multiple frames at once.
* SVG?
* Added control of animations. (Nonlooping)
* Lip sync
