This is a possible to-do list. Not everything here may be a good idea, but it's a collection of ideas and wishes so they don't are forgotten.

* Let games replace the logo in the setup window?
* Allow launching of one SLUDGE game from within another.
* Movie support (this is one for the future - not planned for SLUDGE 2.0)
* Sprite-bank-editor: Allow setting hotspot for multiple frames at once.
* Multi-line comments. (Maybe a feature of the editor?)
* SVG?
* Added control of animations. (Nonlooping)
* Lip sync
* Smoother setCharacterDrawMode (numerical rather than constants)
* Zooming the scene: http://www.adventuredevelopers.com/forum/index.php?topic=2396.0
